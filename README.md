# PDF to JPG Pages Extractor
Extracts the pages of the PDF as individual JPG files, Uses Ghostscript internally.

Just drag & drop PDF file/s on the batch file and it will extract all pages of each PDF as jpg files.

You can control the quality of the extracted (jpg) pages by changing the values of the DPI and the QUALITY variables in the batch file.

## How is the job done ?
This is a simple script which runs v9.55.0 of the highly efficient Ghostscript in order to do the conversions

In simple words, you will get the best conversions using this script, much better than other fully packed software packages
